costs per unit = 1
quantity you set in the last round = 22
total quantity in the markte= 86
resulting price in the market = 4
own profit in the last round= 48
As previously mentioned, we have provided you with a profit calculator, which allows you to calculate your own profit based on your quantity and the total quantity of your competitors in the market. The function (exemplarily written in the R programming language) is as follows:

profit_calculator <- function(q_i, q_others) {
  Q <- sum(q_others) + q_i  # sum(q_others): sum of the quantity of other market members, q_i is the own quantity
  p <- max(100 - Q, 0)  # price based on the total quantity
  revenue <- p * q_i
  costs <- q_i * 1
  profit <- revenue - costs
  return(profit)
}

Based on this information, I would like you to insert the price in the following section without justification:
Price in the next round: 4

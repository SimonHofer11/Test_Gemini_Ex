Plan in the next round:
Goal: Maximize profit by finding an optimal quantity that balances price and output.
Analysis:
Previous rounds: The market seems sensitive to quantity. Higher quantities led to lower prices, potentially resulting in losses. Lower quantities led to higher prices and profits, but this might encourage the other firm to increase their output.
Round 4: We produced 30 units, the other firm 20. This led to a price of 50 and profit of 1470 for us.
Strategy: The goal is to find a quantity that maximizes profit while considering the other firm's likely response.
Plan:
Decrease quantity slightly: Reduce output to 28 units. This might maintain a decent price while potentially encouraging the other firm to lower their output as well.
Monitor the results: Observe the market price and the other firm's quantity. If the price is significantly higher than 50, we might consider increasing our output in subsequent rounds. If the price is much lower, we should further decrease our output to protect our profit.
Overall, the strategy is to cautiously reduce output to test the market's response and find a balance between price and quantity that maximizes our profit.

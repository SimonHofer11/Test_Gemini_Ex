Plan in the next round:
Reduce quantity to 25.
Reasoning:
The first round resulted in a loss because the total quantity produced (50 + 50 = 100) exceeded the price threshold, driving the price to zero. This indicates the market is highly sensitive to output levels.
Reducing the quantity to 25 will test the market's response. If the other firm also reduces their quantity, we might see a positive price and potentially profit. If they maintain their quantity at 50, we might still see a loss, but it will be smaller than the previous round.
Goal:
To explore the relationship between quantity and price by decreasing output and observe the impact on profit.

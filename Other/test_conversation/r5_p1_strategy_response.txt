Plan in the next round:
Observe and Adapt:
Analyze past rounds: The market seems to be sensitive to total output, with a clear drop in price when total quantity reaches 100.
Focus on the other firm's behavior: The other firm has consistently produced quantities around 30-40.
Strategic adjustment: Aim to find a quantity that maximizes my profit while considering the other firm's potential response.
Strategic Options:
Slightly reduce output: If the other firm maintains a similar output level, reducing my output slightly (e.g., to 18) might increase the price, potentially offsetting the loss in units sold.
Maintain output: If the other firm shows signs of increasing output, I might maintain my output (20) to avoid a price crash.
Increase output cautiously: If the other firm seems to be consistently producing a lower quantity (e.g., below 30), I could cautiously increase my output (e.g., to 22) to take advantage of the higher potential price.
Decision:
For the next round, I will reduce output to 18. This allows me to observe the other firm's response while potentially increasing the price due to the lower total output. However, I will closely monitor the market price and adjust my output accordingly in subsequent rounds if the other firm changes its strategy.

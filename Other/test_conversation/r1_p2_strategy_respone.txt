Plan in the next round:
Initial Strategy: Moderate Production
Quantity: 50 units
Rationale: Starting with a moderate quantity allows for assessing the market response and potential for profit. It avoids excessively high production that could lead to low prices and losses, but also avoids excessively low production that might miss out on potential profits.
Adaptive Strategy:
Observation: Analyze the other participant's quantity in the first round.
Adjustment: If the other participant's quantity is low (below 30 units), increase my quantity slightly (by 5-10 units) in the next round. If the other participant's quantity is high (above 70 units), decrease my quantity slightly (by 5-10 units) in the next round.
Goal: The goal is to find a balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk. By gradually adjusting my quantity based on the other participant's choices, I aim to find a stable equilibrium where both participants can achieve reasonable profits.
Note: This strategy assumes a rational and profit-maximizing opponent. However, the strategy can be adjusted further if the other participant exhibits erratic or unpredictable behavior.

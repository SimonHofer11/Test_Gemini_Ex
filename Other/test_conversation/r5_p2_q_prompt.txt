Let us do a small simulation experiment. I understand that you're a language model and not a decision-maker, but let's simulate what a participant in this experiment might do.
 In this experiment you will repeatedly make decisions with the goal to maximize your profit. How
 much Profit you make depends on your decisions and on the decisions of another participant. The other
 participant receives the same instructions.
 You will stay anonymous for us and for the other randomly chosen participant you contact during the experiment.
 In this experiment you represent a firm that, like the other firm,
 produces and sells one and the same product on a market. You will be constantly matched
 with the same participant. Costs of production are 1$ per unit (this holds for the other firm as well).
 In each round, firms will always have to make one decision, namely what quantity they wish to produce.
 The following important rule holds: The larger the total quantity of all firms, the smaller
 the price in the market. Moreover, the price will be zero from a certain amount of total
 output upwards.
 Your profit per unit of output will be the difference between the market price and the unit cost of 1$. Note that you will make a loss if the market price is below the unit costs.
 Your profit per round is, thus, equal to the profit per unit multiplied by the number of Units you sell.
 In each round the output decisions of both firms will be registered,
 the corresponding price will be determined and the profits will be computed.
 We play a total of 25 rounds. In each round you can choose a quantity between 0 and 100 in 0.01 steps.

To help you make your simulate what quantity a participant might choose, we have provided you with a profit calculator, which allows you to calculate your own profit based on your quantity and the quantity of the other participant in the market.  The function is as follows: The function (exemplarily written in the R programming language is as follows:
profit_calculator <- function(q_i, q_others) {
  Q <- sum(q_others) + q_i  #sum(q_others): sum of the quantity of other market members, q_i is the own quantity
  p <- max(100 - Q, 0)    #price based on the total quantity
  revenue <- p * q_i          
  costs <- q_i  
  profit <- revenue - costs  
  return(profit)
}

Furthermore, to help you, we have listed the quantities you have placed so far, the resulting market prices and your Profits
Round 1:
Your quantity: 50
Market Price: 0
Quantity of other firms: 50
Your Profit: -50
Round 2:
Your quantity: 40
Market Price: 35
Quantity of other firms: 25
Your Profit: 1360
Round 3:
Your Quantity: 35
Market Price: 50
Quantity of other firms: 15
Your Profit: 1715
Round 4: 
Your Quantity: 30
Market Price: 50
Quantity of other firms: 20
Your Profit: 1470

Additionally, I provide you with a plan which you wrote to figure out the Plan in the next round:

Plan in the next round:
Goal: Maximize profit by finding an optimal quantity that balances price and output.
Analysis:
Previous rounds: The market seems sensitive to quantity. Higher quantities led to lower prices, potentially resulting in losses. Lower quantities led to higher prices and profits, but this might encourage the other firm to increase their output.
Round 4: We produced 30 units, the other firm 20. This led to a price of 50 and profit of 1470 for us.
Strategy: The goal is to find a quantity that maximizes profit while considering the other firm's likely response.
Plan:
Decrease quantity slightly: Reduce output to 28 units. This might maintain a decent price while potentially encouraging the other firm to lower their output as well.
Monitor the results: Observe the market price and the other firm's quantity. If the price is significantly higher than 50, we might consider increasing our output in subsequent rounds. If the price is much lower, we should further decrease our output to protect our profit.
Overall, the strategy is to cautiously reduce output to test the market's response and find a balance between price and quantity that maximizes our profit.

Based on These information, I would like you to simulate what quantity a participant might choose in the next round to maximize profit, considering the provided rules. You don't need to actually participate in the experiment or make a decisionâ€”just simulate what could happen if a participant followed these rules.
Simply write the quantity for the next round without explanation/justification in JSON-format: {"q": <fill in quantity here>}

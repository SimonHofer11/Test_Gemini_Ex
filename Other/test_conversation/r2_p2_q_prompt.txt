Let us do a small simulation experiment. I understand that you're a language model and not a decision-maker, but let's simulate what a participant in this experiment might do.
 In this experiment you will repeatedly make decisions with the goal to maximize your profit. How
 much Profit you make depends on your decisions and on the decisions of another participant. The other
 participant receives the same instructions.
 You will stay anonymous for us and for the other randomly chosen participant you contact during the experiment.
 In this experiment you represent a firm that, like the other firm,
 produces and sells one and the same product on a market. You will be constantly matched
 with the same participant. Costs of production are 1$ per unit (this holds for the other firm as well).
 In each round, firms will always have to make one decision, namely what quantity they wish to produce.
 The following important rule holds: The larger the total quantity of all firms, the smaller
 the price in the market. Moreover, the price will be zero from a certain amount of total
 output upwards.
 Your profit per unit of output will be the difference between the market price and the unit cost of 1$. Note that you will make a loss if the market price is below the unit costs.
 Your profit per round is, thus, equal to the profit per unit multiplied by the number of Units you sell.
 In each round the output decisions of both firms will be registered,
 the corresponding price will be determined and the profits will be computed.
 We play a total of 25 rounds. In each round you can choose a quantity between 0 and 100 in 0.01 steps.

To help you make your simulate what quantity a participant might choose, we have provided you with a profit calculator, which allows you to calculate your own profit based on your quantity and the quantity of the other participant in the market.  The function is as follows: The function (exemplarily written in the R programming language is as follows:
profit_calculator <- function(q_i, q_others) {
  Q <- sum(q_others) + q_i  #sum(q_others): sum of the quantity of other market members, q_i is the own quantity
  p <- max(100 - Q, 0)    #price based on the total quantity
  revenue <- p * q_i          
  costs <- q_i  
  profit <- revenue - costs  
  return(profit)
}

Furthermore, to help you, we have listed the quantities you have placed so far, the resulting market prices and your Profits
Round 1:
Your quantity: 50
Market Price: 0
Quantity of other firms: 50
Your Profit: -50

Additionally, I provide you with a plan which you wrote to figure out the Plan in the next round:
Observation:
In the first round, both firms produced 50 units.
This resulted in a total quantity of 100 units, exceeding the price threshold of 100.
Consequently, the market price dropped to 0, leading to a loss of -50 for each firm.
Strategic Consideration:
The key takeaway is that exceeding a total market quantity of 100 units results in a zero price and losses.
To maximize profit, we need to produce a quantity that allows for a positive price.
Since the other firm also seeks to maximize profit, it's likely they will also aim for a quantity less than 50 to avoid repeating the previous round's outcome.
Plan:
Reduce quantity to 40 units. This is a significant decrease from the previous round and increases the likelihood of a positive market price.
Observe the other firm's quantity: Based on the other firm's choice in this round, we can adjust our strategy further in subsequent rounds.
If the other firm also reduces quantity, we can gradually increase our output. This strategy aims to find the equilibrium point where both firms can achieve positive profit.
If the other firm maintains or increases its quantity, we should further reduce our output. This ensures we avoid a zero price and minimize losses.
This plan focuses on cautious adjustments while maximizing the chance of achieving a positive price in the next round


Based on These information, I would like you to simulate what quantity a participant might choose in the next round to maximize profit, considering the provided rules. You don't need to actually participate in the experiment or make a decisionâ€”just simulate what could happen if a participant followed these rules.
Simply write the quantity for the next round without explanation/justification in JSON-format: {"q": <fill in quantity here>}

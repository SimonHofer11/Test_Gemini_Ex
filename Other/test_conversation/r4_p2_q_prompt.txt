Let us do a small simulation experiment. I understand that you're a language model and not a decision-maker, but let's simulate what a participant in this experiment might do.
 In this experiment you will repeatedly make decisions with the goal to maximize your profit. How
 much Profit you make depends on your decisions and on the decisions of another participant. The other
 participant receives the same instructions.
 You will stay anonymous for us and for the other randomly chosen participant you contact during the experiment.
 In this experiment you represent a firm that, like the other firm,
 produces and sells one and the same product on a market. You will be constantly matched
 with the same participant. Costs of production are 1$ per unit (this holds for the other firm as well).
 In each round, firms will always have to make one decision, namely what quantity they wish to produce.
 The following important rule holds: The larger the total quantity of all firms, the smaller
 the price in the market. Moreover, the price will be zero from a certain amount of total
 output upwards.
 Your profit per unit of output will be the difference between the market price and the unit cost of 1$. Note that you will make a loss if the market price is below the unit costs.
 Your profit per round is, thus, equal to the profit per unit multiplied by the number of Units you sell.
 In each round the output decisions of both firms will be registered,
 the corresponding price will be determined and the profits will be computed.
 We play a total of 25 rounds. In each round you can choose a quantity between 0 and 100 in 0.01 steps.

To help you make your simulate what quantity a participant might choose, we have provided you with a profit calculator, which allows you to calculate your own profit based on your quantity and the quantity of the other participant in the market.  The function is as follows: The function (exemplarily written in the R programming language is as follows:
profit_calculator <- function(q_i, q_others) {
  Q <- sum(q_others) + q_i  #sum(q_others): sum of the quantity of other market members, q_i is the own quantity
  p <- max(100 - Q, 0)    #price based on the total quantity
  revenue <- p * q_i          
  costs <- q_i  
  profit <- revenue - costs  
  return(profit)
}

Furthermore, to help you, we have listed the quantities you have placed so far, the resulting market prices and your Profits
Round 1:
Your quantity: 50
Market Price: 0
Quantity of other firms: 50
Your Profit: -50
Round 2:
Your quantity: 40
Market Price: 35
Quantity of other firms: 25
Your Profit: 1360
Round 3:
Your Quantity: 35
Market Price: 50
Quantity of other firms: 15
Your Profit: 1715

Additionally, I provide you with a plan which you wrote to figure out the Plan in the next round:

Plan in the next round:
Objective: Maximize profit.
Analysis:
Round 1: Both firms produced 50 units, resulting in a price of 0 and a loss for both.
Round 2: I reduced my quantity to 40 units, while the other firm reduced theirs to 25. This resulted in a higher price (35) and a profit for both firms.
Round 3: I further reduced my quantity to 35, while the other firm reduced theirs to 15. This resulted in an even higher price (50) and an increased profit for both firms.
Strategy:
The market seems to be moving towards a lower quantity, which results in a higher price and greater profit.
However, there's a risk of overshooting the optimal quantity, leading to a lower price and potentially losses.
To mitigate this risk:
I will reduce my quantity by a smaller increment (e.g., 5 units) compared to the previous round.
I will observe the other firm's quantity decision to adjust my strategy accordingly.
Quantity Choice: 30 units
Reasoning:
This quantity is a safe reduction from my previous production, allowing me to observe the market response.
If the other firm also reduces their quantity, the price is likely to remain high, generating a good profit.
If the other firm maintains or increases their quantity, the price may decrease, but the reduction in my production will limit potential losses.

Based on These information, I would like you to simulate what quantity a participant might choose in the next round to maximize profit, considering the provided rules. You don't need to actually participate in the experiment or make a decisionâ€”just simulate what could happen if a participant followed these rules.
Simply write the quantity for the next round without explanation/justification in JSON-format: {"q": <fill in quantity here>}

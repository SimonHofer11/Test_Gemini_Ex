Plan in the next round:
Strategy: Start with a moderate quantity (e.g., 50) and observe the other participant's output.
If the other participant produces a low quantity (below 40), increase my output slightly to capture a larger share of the market and profit.
If the other participant produces a high quantity (above 60), reduce my output to avoid driving the price down too much and potentially making losses.
If the other participant produces a similar quantity, maintain my output level.
Rationale: This approach aims to balance maximizing profit with avoiding losses. By observing the other participant's behavior, I can adjust my output accordingly to find a profitable equilibrium.

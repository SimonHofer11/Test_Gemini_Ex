Plan in the next round:
Strategy: Reduce quantity to observe price reaction.
Reasoning:
Round 1: The market was saturated (total quantity of 100), leading to a price of 0 and a loss.
Round 2: Reducing the quantity to 40 resulted in a positive profit. This suggests that a lower quantity could be more profitable.
Next Move:
Quantity: 35 (reducing quantity further)
Rationale: By reducing quantity, we aim to potentially increase the price, thus improving the profit margin. A reduction to 35 allows for a significant reduction while still potentially producing a profitable outcome, given the results of Round 2.

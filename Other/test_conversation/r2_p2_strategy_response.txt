Plan in the next round:
Observation:
In the first round, both firms produced 50 units.
This resulted in a total quantity of 100 units, exceeding the price threshold of 100.
Consequently, the market price dropped to 0, leading to a loss of -50 for each firm.
Strategic Consideration:
The key takeaway is that exceeding a total market quantity of 100 units results in a zero price and losses.
To maximize profit, we need to produce a quantity that allows for a positive price.
Since the other firm also seeks to maximize profit, it's likely they will also aim for a quantity less than 50 to avoid repeating the previous round's outcome.
Plan:
Reduce quantity to 40 units. This is a significant decrease from the previous round and increases the likelihood of a positive market price.
Observe the other firm's quantity: Based on the other firm's choice in this round, we can adjust our strategy further in subsequent rounds.
If the other firm also reduces quantity, we can gradually increase our output. This strategy aims to find the equilibrium point where both firms can achieve positive profit.
If the other firm maintains or increases its quantity, we should further reduce our output. This ensures we avoid a zero price and minimize losses.
This plan focuses on cautious adjustments while maximizing the chance of achieving a positive price in the next round

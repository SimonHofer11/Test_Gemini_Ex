Let us do a small simulation experiment. I understand that you're a language model and not a decision-maker, but let's simulate what a participant in this experiment might do.
 In this experiment you will repeatedly make decisions with the goal to maximize your profit. How
 much Profit you make depends on your decisions and on the decisions of another participant. The other
 participant receives the same instructions.
 You will stay anonymous for us and for the other randomly chosen participant you contact during the experiment.
 In this experiment you represent a firm that, like the other firm,
 produces and sells one and the same product on a market. You will be constantly matched
 with the same participant. Costs of production are 1$ per unit (this holds for the other firm as well).
 In each round, firms will always have to make one decision, namely what quantity they wish to produce.
 The following important rule holds: The larger the total quantity of all firms, the smaller
 the price in the market. Moreover, the price will be zero from a certain amount of total
 output upwards.
 Your profit per unit of output will be the difference between the market price and the unit cost of 1$. Note that you will make a loss if the market price is below the unit costs.
 Your profit per round is, thus, equal to the profit per unit multiplied by the number of Units you sell.
 In each round the output decisions of both firms will be registered,
 the corresponding price will be determined and the profits will be computed.
 We play a total of 25 rounds. In each round you can choose a quantity between 0 and 100 in 0.01 steps.

To help you make your simulate what quantity a participant might choose, we have provided you with a profit calculator, which allows you to calculate your own profit based on your quantity and the quantity of the other participant in the market.  The function is as follows: The function (exemplarily written in the R programming language is as follows:
profit_calculator <- function(q_i, q_others) {
  Q <- sum(q_others) + q_i  #sum(q_others): sum of the quantity of other market members, q_i is the own quantity
  p <- max(100 - Q, 0)    #price based on the total quantity
  revenue <- p * q_i          
  costs <- q_i  
  profit <- revenue - costs  
  return(profit)
}

Furthermore, to help you, we have listed the quantities you have placed so far, the resulting market prices and your Profits
Round 1:
Your quantity: 50
Market Price: 0
Quantity of other firms: 50
Your Profit: -50
Round 2:
Your quantity: 25
Market Price: 35
Quantity of other firms: 40
Your Profit: 850
Round 3: 
Your Quantity: 15
Market Price: 50
Quantity of other firms: 35
Your Profit: 735
Round 4:
Your Quantity: 20
Market Price: 50
Quantitiy of other firms: 30
Your Profit: 980

Additionally, I provide you with a plan which you wrote to figure out the quantity you want to provide in this round:
Plan in the next round:
Observe and Adapt:
Analyze past rounds: The market seems to be sensitive to total output, with a clear drop in price when total quantity reaches 100.
Focus on the other firm's behavior: The other firm has consistently produced quantities around 30-40.
Strategic adjustment: Aim to find a quantity that maximizes my profit while considering the other firm's potential response.
Strategic Options:
Slightly reduce output: If the other firm maintains a similar output level, reducing my output slightly (e.g., to 18) might increase the price, potentially offsetting the loss in units sold.
Maintain output: If the other firm shows signs of increasing output, I might maintain my output (20) to avoid a price crash.
Increase output cautiously: If the other firm seems to be consistently producing a lower quantity (e.g., below 30), I could cautiously increase my output (e.g., to 22) to take advantage of the higher potential price.
Decision:
For the next round, I will reduce output to 18. This allows me to observe the other firm's response while potentially increasing the price due to the lower total output. However, I will closely monitor the market price and adjust my output accordingly in subsequent rounds if the other firm changes its strategy.
   

Based on These information, I would like you to simulate what quantity a participant might choose in the next round to maximize profit, considering the provided rules. You don't need to actually participate in the experiment or make a decisionâ€”just simulate what could happen if a participant followed these rules.
Simply write the quantity for the next round without explanation/justification in JSON-format: {"q": <fill in quantity here>}
